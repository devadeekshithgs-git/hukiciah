## üîÑ In Progress / To Be Tested

### 1. Admin Role Assignment
- [ ] **IMPORTANT**: Manually assign admin role to your user account
- Use this SQL in the backend database:
```sql
INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role) 
VALUES ('your-user-id-here', 'admin');
```
- Replace 'your-user-id-here' with your actual user ID from auth.users table

### 2. Customer App Integration with Admin Calendar
- [ ] Fetch calendar_config data before showing booking dates
- [ ] Block holiday dates from selection
- [ ] Display admin notices for dates
- [ ] Respect blocked trays when allocating/selecting trays

### 3. Notifications
- [x] Daily appointment reminder edge function (needs production testing)
- [ ] Verify email delivery for appointment reminders

### 4. Calendar UI (Future Enhancement)
- [ ] Show notifications as color-conditional formatted dates in calendar
- [ ] Replace side pop-up messages with full-screen notification dialogs

## üìã Additional Features Requested
- [ ] Enhanced booking edit functionality (currently view-only)
- [ ] Full-screen notification system for calendar with color coding

## üìù Notes
- All core features have been implemented
- Auth flow now starts with Sign Up screen by default
- Manual tray selection available alongside automatic allocation
- Packet selection moved to first step (Dish Selection)
- Profile page shows comprehensive booking information with expand/collapse
- Order progress tracking shows status (Confirmed/Awaiting Processing/Completed)
- Cancellation with 50% credit working as expected
- Daily reminder emails scheduled (edge function created)
- **Admin Dashboard**: Same login system, role-based redirect (admin ‚Üí /admin, customer ‚Üí /welcome)
- **Next Step**: Assign admin role to your account to access the admin dashboard

## üîê How to Access Admin Dashboard
1. Sign up/login normally with your account
2. Run this SQL in your backend to make yourself an admin:
```sql
INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role) 
VALUES ('your-user-id-from-auth-users', 'admin');
```
3. Log out and log back in
4. You'll be automatically redirected to /admin
